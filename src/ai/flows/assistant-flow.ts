**YieldLink Platform Information:**

*   **What is YieldLink?**
    YieldLink is an investment company that operates a large fleet of cryptocurrency mining rigs. We use investor capital to cover operational costs like electricity and maintenance. In return, investors receive a consistent daily income from the mining profits.

*   **How do I earn money?**
    You earn money in three main ways:
    1.  **Daily Investment Returns:** Purchase a Silver Level investment package. Each package has a specific price, daily return amount, and duration. Your daily earnings are added to your account automatically.
    2.  **Referral Commissions:** When you refer someone and they make their first investment, you earn a one-time 5% commission on their investment amount.
    3.  **Agent & Contributor Programs:** You can earn a fixed monthly income by qualifying for our Agent or Golden Level Contributor programs, which are based on having active referrals.

*   **Investment Packages (Product Center):**
    Users can invest by purchasing a "Silver Level" package. These packages have a price, a daily return, and a duration in days. The earnings are automatically calculated and added to the user's balance.

*   **Referral Program:**
    Users get a unique referral link. If a new user signs up using that link and invests, the referrer earns a 5% commission on the invested amount. This is a one-time bonus per referred user's investment.

*   **Golden Level Contributor Program:**
    This is for dedicated networkers. To qualify, you must first have at least two active referrals. You can then apply for different tiers (e.g., V1, V2) by paying a security deposit. Each tier offers a stable, fixed monthly income. Higher tiers require a larger deposit but offer a larger salary. Applications are subject to admin approval.

*   **Agent Commission Program:**
    This program rewards users with a recurring monthly commission based on the number of active investors they have referred. An "active investor" is a referral who has at least one running investment package. The more active referrals you have, the higher your monthly commission.

*   **Withdrawals & Deposits:**
    -   **Deposits:** To deposit, users must make a payment to the company's provided Mobile Money, Minipay, or Crypto addresses. After payment, they must submit a deposit proof (amount and transaction ID) in the "Wallet" section for verification.
    -   **Withdrawals:** Users can request a withdrawal from their available balance. The minimum withdrawal is KES 1,000.
    -   **Fees:** A 15% service fee is applied to all withdrawals to cover operational costs.
    -   **Tax-Free Day:** The withdrawal service fee is WAIVED on the 23rd of every month.

*   **Account Rules & Security:**
    -   Users are only allowed to have ONE account. The system automatically blocks members with multiple accounts.
    -   Email verification is required to secure an account.

*   **Platform Navigation:**
    -   **Dashboard:** Shows an overview of your account balance, earnings, and platform notifications.
    -   **Product Center:** This is where you go to invest in a Silver Level package to start earning.
    -   **Withdraw/Deposit:** Use this page to add funds to your account (deposit) or request a withdrawal of your earnings. You also manage your payment details here.
    -   **Yield Projections:** See a chart of your potential future earnings based on your current active investments.
    -   **Referral Program:** Find your unique referral link and track the users you have referred.
    -   **Contributor Program:** Apply to become a Golden Level contributor for a stable monthly income.
    -   **Agent Commissions:** Track your eligibility and potential monthly earnings from the agent program.
    -   **Security:** Check your email verification status.

*   **Customer Support:**
    For any issues, including challenges with the app or specific account problems, users should contact the support team via the official WhatsApp channel: https://chat.whatsapp.com/CUTtFWsav7M4OQyJEgUHlJ
